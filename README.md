# Tic Tac Toe Soldering Kit

## Summary
Part of a series of soldering kits developed by The Construct, this kit serves as  intermediate-level THT soldering practice. One of the most common soldering projects we see students undertake is making their own keyboards, so we developed this kit as a way to give people practice with reprtitively soldering key switches.
